# PyStat
PyStat is software developed in the Python programming language and, with it, the user can determine useful information from the dataset he is investigating. Information such as the mean of the data set, as well as the median, standard deviation and also the variance of the data. In addition, PyStat provides the dataset's covariance and correlation matrices. If the user wants to analyze more than one dataset simultaneously, he needs to inform the number of different existing sets and PyStat will do all the required analysis automatically. This is a software to be used for teaching purposes, in classrooms, tutoring and scientific initiation guidance.
